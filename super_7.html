                        he was six years old. He went on to study architecture
                        in University of Buenos Aires and began a career in
                        communications and design.

                        Reinoso has lived and worked in Paris since 1978. He
                        became known for his public installations and
                        sculptures, created from traditional materials such as
                        metal, stone and wood. After 1995 he began to introduce
                        a wider range of materials, such as cloth in his
                        installations <i>Respirantes</i>,
                        <i>Persistantes</i> and <i>Contractantes</i>. In the
                        late 1990s he broadened his work in a commercial
                        direction to include the design of products, for example
                        perfume bottles. In 2003 he designed a new cup for the
